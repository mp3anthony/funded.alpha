# funded.

**Fund the house first. Everything else comes second.**

Funded is a household cash-flow app that answers one question per payday: *how much should each person transfer to cover the bills?* It isn't a budgeting tool that tracks every coffee — it calculates each contributor's share of household expenses so bills are covered before personal spending begins.

## Features

- **Payday transfers** — enter income per contributor and the app calculates exact weekly transfer amounts to cover household bills in full
- **Bill tracking** — manage bills across any frequency (weekly, fortnightly, monthly, yearly) with paid/due-soon/overdue status tracking
- **Frequency normalisation** — all bills convert to a common frequency for apples-to-apples comparison
- **Savings goals** — sinking funds with targets, progress tracking, and manual top-ups
- **Contribution rules** — define rules that auto-allocate surplus income above a threshold to goals or increased contributions
- **Payment modes** — choose between Joint Fund (pooled pot) or Direct Pay (split bills between members)
- **Multi-member households** — invite members via join code, manage roles (owner/member), and assign bill splits
- **Health score** — weighted financial health score (0–100) based on bill status, goal progress, and budget coverage
- **Notifications** — in-app notification centre with bill-due alerts, snooze, read/unread state, and per-type settings
- **Light and dark mode** — automatic via `prefers-color-scheme` CSS media query, with a manual class-based override (`.dark` / `.light`) toggle in settings
- **PWA** — installable as a home screen app on iOS Safari and Android Chrome with full offline fallback
- **Authentication** — email/password auth via Supabase (implicit flow, session persisted in `localStorage`), email confirmation, and password reset

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18.x
- **npm** (ships with Node)
- A **Supabase** project ([create one free](https://supabase.com/dashboard))

---

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mp3anthony/funded.alpha.git
cd funded-nextjs

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create your environment file
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Then fill in your Supabase credentials (see below)

# 4. Run the database migrations (see Database setup)

# 5. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Available scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build |
| `npm run start` | Serve the production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |

---

## Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following values:

```env
# ── Client (safe to expose to the browser) ──
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# ── Web push (VAPID) ──
NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your-vapid-public-key
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your-vapid-private-key
VAPID_CONTACT_EMAIL=mailto:admin@example.com

# ── Server-only: reminder cron (never prefix with NEXT_PUBLIC_) ──
# Service-role key bypasses RLS; used only by the server cron. Keep secret.
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
# Shared secret Vercel Cron sends as the Authorization bearer token.
CRON_SECRET=a-long-random-string
```

The Supabase URL and anon key are available in your Supabase project dashboard
under **Settings → API**. The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is on the same page —
treat it like a password and never expose it to the client. `CRON_SECRET` is any
long random string; set the identical value in Vercel so the daily reminder cron
(`/api/cron/push-reminders`) can authenticate.

> **Note:** `.env*` files are git-ignored by default. Never commit real credentials.
> A `.env.local.example` template (no real values) is provided as a starting point.

---

## Database setup

The Supabase schema is defined in the `supabase/` directory. Run these SQL files in order via the Supabase SQL Editor:

1. **`supabase/schema.sql`** — core tables: `households`, `bills`, `funds`, `paydays`
2. **`supabase/household_members_table.sql`** — the `household_members` table
3. **`supabase/rls_policies.sql`** — row-level security policies
4. **`supabase/secure_rls_policies.sql`** — additional hardened RLS rules
5. **`supabase/migrations/`** — apply each migration file in order:
   - `add_missing_schema_tables_and_columns.sql` — pay schedules, pay history, bill splits, household contributions, contribution rules, and additional columns
   - `add_user_id_and_constraints.sql` — user ID foreign keys and constraints
   - `add_join_code.sql` — household join codes
   - `update_join_code_type.sql` — join code type update
   - `fix_households_rls.sql` — RLS policy fixes
   - `fix_households_rls_recursion.sql` — recursive RLS fix
   - `fix_household_members_select.sql` — member select policy fix
   - `20260707005200_update_frequency_data_to_fortnightly.sql` — normalises frequency data to fortnightly

### Edge Functions

- **`supabase/functions/join-household/`** — serverless function that handles household join code validation and member addition

### Storage

Create an `avatars` bucket in Supabase Storage (Settings → Storage) with **public access** enabled for avatar image uploads.

## Screens

| Route | Screen | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `/` | **Dashboard** | Health score, upcoming bills, active goals, recent activity feed |
| `/payday` | **Payday** | Pay schedules, income entry (fixed or variable), pay history, surplus rule triggers |
| `/bills` | **Bills** | All household bills with status badges, category filters, search, and frequency normalisation toggle |
| `/funds` | **Goals** | Savings goals with progress bars, manual top-ups, and completion tracking |
| `/settings` | **Settings** | Household name, payment mode (Joint Fund / Direct Pay), member management, contributions, surplus rules, theme toggle, join codes, notifications |
| `/login` | **Login** | Email/password authentication (sign in or sign up) |
| `/confirm-email` | **Confirm Email** | Email verification landing page |
| `/reset-password` | **Reset Password** | Password update page reached via Supabase reset email link |
| `/auth` | **Auth Callback** | Supabase auth redirect handler |
| `/offline` | **Offline** | PWA offline fallback page |

### User flow

1. **Sign up** → email confirmation → **Onboarding** (5 steps: name household, choose payment mode, add first pay schedule, add first bill, review)
2. **Dashboard** shows household health at a glance
3. **Payday** to log income when paid — surplus rules fire automatically; surplus suggestion modal prompts allocation
4. **Bills** to manage household costs
5. **Goals** to track savings targets
6. **Settings** to invite members, configure contributions, rules, and notification preferences
7. **Forgot password** → reset email → `/reset-password` to set a new password

---

## Design system

### Typography

Fonts are loaded via `next/font/google` for optimal performance (no external CDN requests at runtime).

| Font | CSS Variable | Use |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **Syne** (400–800) | `--font-heading` | Display headings, wordmark |
| **Instrument Sans** (400–600) | `--font-body` | Body text, inputs, UI labels |
| **JetBrains Mono** (400–600) | `--font-mono` | Numeric values, monospace data |

### Colour tokens

All colours are defined as CSS custom properties in `globals.css` and mapped into Tailwind v4 via `@theme inline`.

| Token | Dark mode | Light mode |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| `--color-primary` (lime) | `#c8ff00` | `#7aaa00` |
| `--color-background` | `#0a0a0a` | `#f2f2ee` |
| `--color-success` (green) | `#00e676` | `#00994a` |
| `--color-accent` (amber) | `#ffab00` | `#c07800` |
| `--color-destructive` (red) | `#ff3d57` | `#cc2233` |
| `--color-surface` | `#111111` | `#e8e8e4` |
| `--color-foreground` | `#f0f0f0` | `#0f0f0f` |
| `--color-muted` | `#999999` | `#444444` |
| `--color-border` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.07)` | `rgba(0,0,0,0.09)` |

### Theme switching

- **Automatic:** CSS `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)` sets light tokens on `:root` when no class is present
- **Manual:** toggle in Settings writes `.dark` or `.light` class to `<html>`, overriding the media query
- **Layered surfaces:** `--color-surface`, `--color-surface-raised`, `--color-surface-elevated` provide depth

### Mobile-first considerations

- `viewport-fit=cover` and `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding for notched devices
- All inputs forced to `font-size: 16px` to prevent iOS Safari auto-zoom
- `touch-action: manipulation` on interactive elements to eliminate tap delay

---

## Key logic

### Frequency conversion

`convertAmount(amount, fromFrequency, toFrequency)` normalises any amount between `weekly`, `fortnightly`, `monthly`, and `yearly` using standard budgeting coefficients (4.33 weeks/month, 2.16 bi-weeks/month).

### Health score

`calculateHealthScore()` returns 0–100 based on three weighted factors:

| Factor | Weight | Scoring |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Bills management | 40% | –20 points per overdue bill |
| Goals & contributions | 30% | 80 base + 20 if any goal has progress; 50 if nothing set up |
| Budget coverage | 30% | Ratio of contributions (or splits) to total monthly expenses |

### Payment modes

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **Joint Fund** | All contributors pay into a shared pot; contributions are compared against total bills |
| **Direct Pay** | Bills are split between specific members via `BillSplit` records; each person pays their assigned share |

### Contribution rules

When a pay entry exceeds a contributor's threshold, a configurable percentage is automatically allocated to a goal or added as an increased contribution.

---

## PWA support

Funded is a Progressive Web App. The following files enable installation and offline support:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `public/manifest.json` | App name, theme colour (`#c8ff00`), icons, display mode (`standalone`) |
| `public/sw.js` | Service worker with cache-first strategy and offline fallback |
| `public/icons/` | App icons at 192×192 and 512×512 |
| `src/app/offline/` | Offline fallback page |

The service worker is **automatically unregistered in development** (localhost) and only registers in production.

---

## Deployment

### Vercel (current)

The app is deployed on Vercel. Pushes to `main` trigger an automatic production deployment.

```bash
npm run build
# Deploy via Vercel CLI or Git integration on the main branch
```

### Environment variables

Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are configured in your deployment platform's environment settings.

---

## Contributing

This is a solo project developed under a structured **Lead Developer Liaison Protocol**: a single orchestrator session is the sole point of contact and routes every request to specialised subagents (Interviewer, Issue logger, Investigator, Planner, Implementation, Docs, Code Reviewer). The full protocol lives in [`.agents/AGENTS.md`](.agents/AGENTS.md) — the short version:

- **Issues & PRDs** are tracked as GitHub issues on `mp3anthony/funded.alpha` via the `gh` CLI, triaged with canonical labels (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`).
- **Problem Agreement** — the problem must be fully scoped — is reached before any investigation or planning. **Plan Agreement** — an approved implementation plan, including rejected alternatives — is reached before any code is written.
- **Every change goes on a branch**, which triggers an automatic Vercel preview deployment for testing before merge.
- **Preview testing is iPhone-only** (Apple iPhone 17, iOS/WebKit), but code must be written to work correctly on **both** iOS and Android. Android is exercised post-merge on `main` by real users; anything they hit routes back through the normal reporting flow.
- **Closing the linked GitHub issue is the go-ahead to merge** into `main`. The version number is decided with Anthony at merge time (see Versioning).
- Decision records live in [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/); domain terms in [`docs/GLOSSARY.md`](docs/GLOSSARY.md).

### Code conventions

- **TypeScript** — strict types, no `any` unless explicitly suppressed with a comment
- **Components** — one component per file, `PascalCase` filenames
- **State** — centralised in `AppContext.tsx`; pages consume via `useApp()` and `useCurrentUser()` hooks
- **Styling** — Tailwind utility classes referencing CSS custom property tokens; avoid hard-coded colour values

---

## Versioning

The app is currently at **v0.9.1** (shown at the bottom of the Settings screen). Until it's declared ready for wider testing, each merged change bumps the **last decimal** (`v0.9.1` → `v0.9.2` → `v0.9.3` …). `v0.9.0` was deliberately skipped.

> **Note:** This table is a loose guideline, not an enforced rule. The actual version applied at each
> merge is decided with Anthony directly at merge time, via the Version check step in
> [`.agents/AGENTS.md`](.agents/AGENTS.md).

| Milestone | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Ongoing pre-testing changes | last-decimal bump (`v0.9.x`) |
| Ready for wider testers | `v0.10.0` |
| Public beta | `v1.0.0` |
